# Description


Shavi‚Äôs Restaurant is an app that allows Shavi‚Äôs Restaurant customers to view the restaurant menu. They also can order a meal and choose the deliver method that can be carryout or delivery.
## Goals
My goal is to build a fully responsive web application that is secured and that meets my client requirement.

##### Planning

This project involved using a REST API for a restaurant that allows it customers to make online order. The restaurant admin will have access to update 
food and to handle delivery tracking.
The database has endpoints for users and admins, which require proper authentication using a JSON Web Token.

In the application the customer is given a responsive platform.

## Project Challenges

![ERD image](https://github.com/diaba/shaviRestaurant-server/blob/main/image/challenge.png "Final ERD")
1. The first coding challenge that took me a significant time to solve was with deploying my backend to AWS. After multiple 
tries to fix it I request an issue ticket. I found out that I needed to do more configuration on AWS side.
2. I run to login credentials issues using JWT. I discovered that I did not configure correctly my dependencies.

3. When implementing my backend my biggest challenge was to transfer temporary data without sending it to the server. After
talking with my project lead I used localstorage functionalities.
